# ðŸŒ± Lucas' Learning Repository

# THIS WILL START ON JAN 1 2025!

Welcome to my **Learning Repository**! This is my central hub for all the resources, tutorials, articles, courses, and notes that I accumulate while expanding my skill set. Here, you'll find an organized record of what I've learned and what I'm currently exploring. Whether it's diving deeper into **Full-Stack Development**, experimenting with **AI/ML**, sharpening **Data Structures & Algorithms** knowledge, or learning about **System Design**, this space will track my progress over time.

I plan to update this repository regularly as I discover new materials, tackle new challenges, and reflect on my ongoing learning journey.

## How to Use This Repository

Each section below is organized into tables where Iâ€™ll list out articles, courses, projects, or any other resources I engage with. Think of each table as a log that helps me track my progress and gather reflections on what Iâ€™ve learned.

**Columns Explained**:  
- **Resource**: The name of the article, course, video, or project.  
- **Type**: Classifies the resource (e.g., Article, Online Course, Tutorial, Documentation, Project).  
- **Description**: A short summary of what the resource covers.  
- **Date**: When I started or finished the resource.  
- **Notes/Reflections**: Key takeaways, thoughts, or future actions after using the resource.

*(Initially, these tables will be empty. I will populate them as I go along.)*

## Future Directions

- **Daily Challenges App**: Iâ€™ll integrate resources related to building and improving this app, along with any AI/ML articles once I start implementing machine learning for personalized challenges.
- **AI Integration**: As I progress, I plan to add sections for data preprocessing, model deployment, and handling real-world challenges in AI applications.
- **Long-Term Projects**: When I embark on larger, multi-month projects, Iâ€™ll add dedicated sub-sections to track iterative progress, research, and pivots.
